# Data Science Project

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict the direction of S&P 500 monthly returns.

## Overview

The aim is to forecast monthly trends in the S&P 500 index using classification algorithms.
By analyzing historical data, the project attempts to classify whether SPY(used as proxy for S$P500) will go up over a certain threshold in the following month.
